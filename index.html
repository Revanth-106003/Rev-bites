            <p>
                <span>Wash and Soak Rice:</span> Rinse the rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes.<br>
                <span>Cook the Rice:</span> In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat the ghee over medium heat. Drain the rice and add it to the pot. Saut√© the rice for a couple of minutes until it's lightly toasted.<br>
                <span>Add Milk:</span> Pour in the milk and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer. Stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot.<br>
                <span>Simmer:</span> Let the rice cook in the milk for about 30-40 minutes or until the rice is completely cooked and the milk has thickened. Keep stirring occasionally.<br>
                <span>Add Sugar and Flavorings:</span> Add the sugar and stir until it dissolves completely. Mix in the cardamom powder, chopped nuts, raisins (if using), and saffron strands.<br>
                <span>Simmer Again:</span> Continue to simmer for another 5-10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the kheer reaches your desired consistency.<br>
                <span>Serve:</span> Remove from heat and let it cool slightly. Serve warm or chilled, garnished with more nuts if desired.
